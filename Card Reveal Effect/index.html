        <h3>The Lich King</h3>
        <p>
          The Lich King is the master and lord of the Scourge, which he rules
          telepathically from the Frozen Throne atop the Icecrown Glacier.
          <br />
          <br />
          Kil'jaeden created the Lich King ages ago from the spirit of the orc
          shaman Ner'zhul to raise an undead army to conquer Azeroth for the
          Burning Legion. Initially trapped within the Frozen Throne with
          Frostmourne, the Lich King eventually betrayed Kil'jaeden and merged
          with the human Arthas Menethil. When Frostmourne was destroyed and
          Arthas perished, Bolvar Fordragon became the new Lich King,
          imprisoning the master of the Scourge within the Frozen Throne once
          more in order to protect the world from future threats. Following the
          events of Battle for Azeroth, Sylvannas Windrunner traveled to
          Icecrown to fight Bolvar, eventually tearing the helm from his head.
          She then destroyed the crown, and presumably, the lich king along with
          it. <br />
          <br />
          The Lich King is voiced by Michael McConnohie.
